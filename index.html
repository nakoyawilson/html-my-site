  <p>I am a Web and Android Developer in training. I learned HTML as a preteen and now I am relearning it along with CSS and JavaScript. I began learning Kotlin on March 29, 2021 and Python on June 7, 2021. Previously, I taught myself to do pointed
    pen calligraphy where I specialised in Copperscript and Spencerian.</p>
